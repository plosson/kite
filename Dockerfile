# deployed node_modules can break the runtime stage without a line of this
# repository changing. That happened once; see the deploy step below.

# the build tree — a path that does not exist in the runtime stage, so the image
# starts, fails to resolve @open-artifact/shared, and crash-loops. Replacing it
# with the real files is what makes the runtime stage self-contained.
#
# The check on the end is not decoration. This failed silently once: the image
# built, pushed and started before anything said the package was unreachable.
# A build that produces a broken image must fail here, not in production.
