/**
 * The MCP tools, and the registry the route dispatches over.
 *
 * Every tool acts as one person, through one connection. Two rules hold across
 * all of them and are the whole security story of the endpoint:
 *
 * 1. A connection may only touch what it published. Reads, updates, shares and
 *    comment actions all filter on `artifacts.connectionId`. Something published
 *    from the CLI, the web, or another assistant is invisible here, and the error
 *    says exactly why rather than pretending it does not exist.
 *
 *    The three organizing tools are the one exception, on purpose: sorting a
 *    library only works on the whole library. They reach everything the person
 *    owns, but only its title, description, summary and placement — never its
 *    content, its sharing or its comments.
 *
 * 2. Errors come back as tool results with `isError: true`, never as JSON-RPC
 *    protocol errors, because a protocol error can be swallowed by the client's
 *    harness before the model ever sees it. The dispatcher turns every ApiError
 *    into such a result; only an unexpected bug becomes a protocol error.
 *
 * The dangerous abilities — delete, make public, share a whole domain, read other
 * people's documents — are absent by construction. There is no tool to reach for,
 * so an injected instruction in a comment has nowhere good to go.
