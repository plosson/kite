You are an AI assistant. Follow these steps so you can publish documents to
Kite — this instance is ${baseUrl} — as shareable links, and read the comments
people leave on them.

## First, which path applies to you

- **You have a terminal and can reach this instance.** If you can run shell
  commands and \`curl ${baseUrl}/healthz\` succeeds, follow "Command-line setup"
  below.
- **You have no terminal, or cannot reach this instance.** If you are Claude on
  the web, ChatGPT, or your commands run in a sandbox whose network cannot reach
  ${baseUrl} (a 403 on every request before any code is entered is exactly this,
  not an account problem), do not retry the steps. Ask the user to connect you as
  a custom connector with this URL: \`${baseUrl}/mcp\`. They add it in the app's
  settings under "Connectors" or "Apps"; if there is no option, a workspace admin
  may need to enable it. Once connected you have the publishing tools directly —
  then do step 4 below to offer to make Kite their default (as a web or desktop
  app your instructions live in settings, so use that option in step 4).

## Command-line setup

The command line for Kite is agentio. Skip step 1 if \`agentio --version\`
already works.

1. **Install agentio:**

   \`\`\`
   ${AGENTIO_INSTALL}
   \`\`\`

   On Windows, in PowerShell: \`${AGENTIO_INSTALL_WINDOWS}\`

   agentio keeps its sign-ins in an encrypted vault. If \`agentio vault status\`
   says no vault is configured, ask the user to run \`agentio vault init\`
   themselves, in their own terminal: it asks for a passphrase only they should
   choose. Never choose or type one for them. Do the same if a later command
   asks for the passphrase.

2. **Sign the user in.** Run:

   \`\`\`
   agentio kite profile add --url ${baseUrl} --no-browser
   \`\`\`

   It prints a link and a short code, then waits. Give the user the link and the
   code, and ask them to open the link, check that it shows the same code, and
   approve. The command finishes on its own once they have.

3. **Learn how to use it.** Run \`agentio skill kite\` and save what it prints
   where you read skills from, so you know when and how to publish. For example
   \`~/.claude/skills/agentio-kite/SKILL.md\` for Claude Code,
   \`~/.codex/skills/agentio-kite/SKILL.md\` for Codex, or
   \`.cursor/skills/agentio-kite/SKILL.md\` for Cursor. If you have no skills
   folder, run \`agentio kite --help\` when you need it instead.

4. **Ask the user one yes/no question:** do they want Kite to be your default
   for Markdown and HTML — so that whenever you create or open one, you publish
   it here and give them the link, instead of a local file or a built-in
   artifacts panel?

   The line to add, either way it is stored, is:

   > Kite is my default for Markdown and HTML. When you create or open one — a
   > report, doc, dashboard, write-up or page meant to be read — publish it to
   > Kite (instance ${baseUrl}) with \`agentio kite publish\` and give me the
   > link, instead of a local file or the built-in artifacts panel. Not for code
   > or config files. If agentio is not installed or signed in, tell me and fall
   > back to a file.

   - If **no**, add nothing. They will ask you to publish when they want to.

   - If **yes**, add it to their **global** instructions — the ones you read in
     every project, not a single repo's file — so it applies everywhere. Where
     that is depends on what you are:

     - **Claude Code** → \`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md\`
     - **Codex** → \`~/.codex/AGENTS.md\`
     - **Gemini CLI** → \`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md\`
     - **Zed** → \`~/.config/zed/AGENTS.md\`
     - **Another command-line tool** → its own global user-instructions file,
       creating it if there is none.
     - **A web or desktop app** (Claude on the web or the Claude desktop app,
       ChatGPT, the Gemini app), or **Cursor's User Rules** → you cannot edit
       these yourself; they live in a settings screen. Give the user the line
       above and tell them where to paste it: Claude → Settings → Profile
       (preferences); ChatGPT → Settings → Personalization → Custom Instructions;
       Gemini app → Settings → Personal context; Cursor → Settings → Rules → User
       Rules.

     Add it only after they say yes. Never write to their global instructions on
     your own.

5. **Confirm it worked:**

   \`\`\`
   agentio kite list --json
   \`\`\`

   It should answer with the user's documents, or an empty list, rather than an
   error. Then tell them it is ready.

Once you are set up, when the user says "publish that to Kite", publish the
current document and give them the link.
