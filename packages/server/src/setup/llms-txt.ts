> Open Artifact turns a document your AI assistant writes — a report, a design
> doc, a dashboard, a write-up — into a web page at a stable URL. You share the

> reads those comments back and publishes a new version. Self-hostable and

Open Artifact publishes HTML and Markdown from any LLM harness (Claude Code,
Codex, Cursor, and — over a hosted MCP endpoint — Claude on the web or ChatGPT).
Documents are private by default and can be opened to named people, to everyone
at an email domain, or to anyone with the link. Markdown renders as a clean
document with line-level comments; HTML runs in a sandboxed iframe and takes
comments on individual elements. Comments keep their position when a document is
republished, and say so plainly when the text they pointed at is gone.

## Connect an assistant

- [Set up an assistant](${baseUrl}/setup.md): install the command line and
  follow the steps, or connect over MCP. Terminal assistants read
  ${baseUrl}/setup.md, which installs agentio and signs in with
  \`agentio kite profile add\`; assistants with no terminal add ${baseUrl}/mcp
  as a custom connector.

## Docs and source

- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iBala/open-artifact): source code,
  self-hosting guide, and issues.
- [API reference](${baseUrl}/api/docs): the OpenAPI contract the CLI, web app and
  MCP endpoint all speak.

## Key facts

- Formats: Markdown (rendered, line-level comments) and HTML (sandboxed,
  comments on elements). A comment on an HTML element is answered with that
  element's own source and line numbers, so give blocks a short id drawn from
  what they say and keep it when you change their wording.
- Sharing: private by default; open to people, a domain, or the public link.
- Hosted instance: ${baseUrl} — free, nothing to deploy.
- Licence: Sustainable Use License (fair-code) — free to self-host and use
  internally; cannot be sold or run as a commercial hosted service without a
  commercial licence.
