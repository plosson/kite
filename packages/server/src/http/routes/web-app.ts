/**
 * Serving the web app.
 *
 * The built app is copied into this package and served from the same origin as
 * the API. That is what makes the whole product one container with nothing to
 * configure: no separate static host, no CORS, and a session cookie that just
 * works because there is only one origin.
 *
 * Everything the server owns is registered before this, so the catch-all only
 * ever sees addresses that belong to the app.
 *
 * ## Why this document has a Content-Security-Policy
 *
 * An artifact is a stranger's page, and the app shows it in an iframe. The frame
 * is sandboxed without `allow-same-origin`, so script inside it runs at an opaque
 * origin and cannot touch the reader's session. That is the whole security model
 * of the product, and it holds.
 *
 * What it does not do on its own is stop the artifact navigating **its own
 * frame** somewhere else. A sandboxed frame may replace itself, and the page it
 * lands on inherits the sandbox flags, the opaque origin, and — from the app's
 * point of view — the very same `contentWindow` object. So a page the publisher
 * controls, and can change after publishing, becomes indistinguishable from the
 * artifact when the app checks `event.source` on a message.
 *
 * `frame-src 'self'` closes that. It applies to every navigation of a nested
 * frame, not only the first, so the frame can hold nothing but this instance's
 * own content. Without it the identity check the comment bridge relies on leans
 * on nothing at all, which is why this lands before the bridge does.
