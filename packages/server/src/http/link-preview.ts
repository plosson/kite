/**
 * What an artifact URL says about itself when it is pasted somewhere.
 *
 * Slack, iMessage, X and the rest fetch the page and read its meta tags to draw
 * a card. Until now every artifact URL drew the same card — the product's own
 * pitch — so sharing a document told the reader nothing about the document.
 *
 * ## The rule this file exists to hold
 *
 * An unfurler arrives with no cookies. It is not signed in, it never will be,
 * and whatever these tags say is shown to everybody who can see the message the
 * link was pasted into. So the ONLY thing that may decide what a card says is
 * whether the artifact is public. Never who is asking.
 *
 * That is not a simplification, it is the safety property. If the card varied by
 * session, an owner's browser and a shared cache between it and the internet
 * would be one misconfiguration away from handing a stranger a private
 * document's title. Reading `isPublic` and nothing else makes that impossible
 * rather than unlikely.
 *
 *   public, live      ->  the document's own title and description, or its
 *                         opening line when it has none
 *   anything else     ->  that an artifact is here, and nothing about it
 *   no such artifact  ->  the site's ordinary card
 *
 * ## What the middle row gives away, and why that was chosen
 *
 * A private artifact's card confirms the URL belongs to something real, which
 * the generic card would not. That was a deliberate call: slugs are 24 random
 * characters, about 141 bits (see ids.ts), so nobody reaches this page by
 * guessing. Confirming existence to somebody already holding the URL tells them
 * what the sign-in page they are about to see would tell them anyway.
 *
 * It does mean a leaked URL — a forwarded mail, a proxy log — now says "this is
 * a real private artifact" rather than nothing at all. That is the whole of the
 * trade, and it buys recipients of a legitimately shared link a card that does
 * not look like a broken advert.
