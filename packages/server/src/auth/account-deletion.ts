/**
 * Closing an account.
 *
 * This is deliberately not a hard delete of the person's row. Their comments on
 * other people's artifacts stay where they are, word for word, because taking
 * the words out would tear holes in conversations other people are still having.
 * A reply that answers a question would be left answering nothing.
 *
 * So the row survives with nothing identifying on it, and everything that
 * pointed at the person either goes or forgets who it was:
 *
 *   goes    their artifacts and everything hanging off them, their sessions and
 *           CLI tokens, their sign-in codes, their notifications, every share
 *           that named them, every mention of them, and their workspaces.
 *   forgets their comments and threads on other people's artifacts, and other
 *           people's notifications that they caused. Those keep their shape and
 *           lose the name.
 *
 * Everything happens in one transaction. A half-deleted account is worse than a
 * whole one: some of it would be gone and the person would still be signed in.

 *
 * - Unique, because users.email is unique and two people closing their accounts
 *   must not collide. The user id is already the unique thing about the row, so
 *   the address is built from it.
 * - Undeliverable, so no mail can ever reach it. `.invalid` is reserved by RFC
 *   2606 precisely for this: it is guaranteed never to resolve, anywhere.
 * - Impossible to sign in to. Asking for a sign-in code sends the digits to the
 *   address, and nobody can read mail at an address that cannot receive any.
 *
 * The id is lowercased because every address in this database is stored
 * lowercased and comparisons everywhere assume it. Two ids that differ only in
 * case would collide, which needs sixteen characters to match case-insensitively
 * by chance, so it will not happen.
